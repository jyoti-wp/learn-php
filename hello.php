<!-- // breaking up different files  -->

<!-- <?php

// mostly use require rather than inclue or include_once or require_once

// the only difference it will include the file only once no matter how many times we add it 

// if you use require it stops the execuetion and inclue does not 

// you can use both but just make sure to keep it simple 
// these are basically used for large paths or if statements.
